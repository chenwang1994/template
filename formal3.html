			<h1>Summary</h1>
			<p>  Lastly, I would like to talk about my future career field, I want my future job relative to automotive. For instance, I could be a Market and Sale Director and employ in an auto company. While my current short goal is graduate from business school become auto marketer. I have a thought that I am gifted at marketing not only because my father engage in this filed; also I am really love this career. For my future career, I will focus on market researching about auto and making the market analysis. In addition to research auto market, I have seen a researching report that how auto impacts the chinaâ€™s economic, also author assumed that the auto market in china is booming and would soon become first in the world.</p> 
 </p>The reason that I choose MSU because it has high ranking on the marketing major also on the all other business major. For the marketing major student, Economic and Math124 as required class in first two years. When I first time to the orientation, the professor has mentioned the average annual salary for marketing major is about $45,000 first year graduated. I think marketing is a potential major, and I hope every marketing major student could find a good job!Good Luck!                                 </p>
