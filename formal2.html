			<p>   What is marketing? What is that stand for? I think everyone has their own answers for these question. Today, we are going to explore more about marketing, including the concept of marketing, analysis of real case, interview with my previous marketing course teacher, and interview with my friend who is major in marketing as well.          
  Simply, marketing is the process of communicating the value of product with customer, the primary purpose of marketing is selling product and device. We could always contact with marketing, for instance, if you want to purchase something there is sale man who introduces the function of the product to you and discuss the price with you, then you will make a decision, buy it or not. There also many research on customer’s behavior, such as B2C buying behavior and B2B buying behavior. Meet and guide the demand of consumer is the starting point and the center of marketing 
                                                               
activities. Enterprise must take the consumer as the center, in the face of the changing environment, to make the right response, so as to adapt to the changing requirements of consumers. Meet the needs of the consumers include not only the demand of now, also includes the potential demand in the future. Now the requirements of performance for the purchase of existing products, potential demand is characterized by some features of desire of products is still to come. Enterprise should through the product development and use of various marketing methods, to stimulate and guide the consumer to create new demand. The analysis of the environment, choose target market, identify and develop products, product pricing, distribution, promotion and services, and coordination between them, for best combination, is the main content of the marketing activities. Marketing mix in there are four basic variables can be artificially controlled, namely product, price, and promotion methods (sales) site. Since the English of the four variables begin with the letter "P", so called "4 ps". Enterprise marketing activities have to do is keeping a close eye on uncontrollable external environment changes, appropriately, combination "4 ps" one thousand ways to make the enterprise can control variables (4 ps) and the external environment uncontrollable variables adapt quickly, whether it is enterprise management, enterprise survival and development of the key to success.</p> 
  </p>To reach the company target is the purpose of marketing activities. Different companies have different business environment, the development of different 
                                                            
enterprises will be at different times, different product's stage in the life cycle is also different, therefore, the goals of the enterprise is varied, profits, output, production, sales, market share, productivity growth and social responsibility are likely to become the target of enterprise, but whatever the goal, all must complete exchange through effective marketing activities, deal with customers in order to achieve.</p>	   

                                                  
  </p>The graph above shows a process of formal product come out, the most important step is ask customers if they like the new product, this step also takes long time to obtain because the company has to do market research. There is a sale strategy be needed between sell the improved product and assess progress, because company has to establish a perfect marketing plan such as advertising, which plays an important 
                                                            
role in the process. According to modern management theories, successful enterprises must be highly customer-oriented and marketing is no longer the job of a particular functional department of an enterprise. Each successful company has their own marketing team, they all follow few steps which are Opportunity identification, New product development,Customer attraction, Customer retention and loyalty building, and Order fulfillment. I intend to use a real case to explore the real marketing and how it works in real marketing.</p> 
  </p>I have read a scholar journey, which called “In China, the gut is a key marketing tool.” This journey describes that GM Automotive planed to import two full size SUVs ,which were popular in US, to China. However, they has faced many challenges on his attempt to gauge Chinese consumers' response to the Chevrolet Tahoe and TrailBlazer SUVs. Before importing these two products, they have to do 
the marketing research to get an idea about the preferences of Chinese consumers. During the research, they found that even China's auto market has been growing by leaps and bounds, its marketing environment, hampered by a secrecy-prone society, lack of data and wide regional variations, has not kept pace. Making marketing decisions here, therefore, still is much more an art than a science. Then there's the problem of regional variations. National sales and production figures aren't much use where China is concerned because income levels, geographical conditions, distribution channels and tastes vary widely by region. Auto marketing in china is 
                                                          
growing, the demand of car is growing as well, many families even have three cars. Auto company regarded china auto market as major target, focusing their time and energy on china auto market, some of them designed exclusive edition for China.</p>  
 </p> For now , in a highly competitive environment, the ability to create competitive edges over one’s adversaries and to achieve ultimate victory in fierce competitions depends not so much on materials resources as on the mental factors of intelligence and concepts. Those concepts that can lead to new visions and perspectives and those approaches that can effectively solve problems will have the greatest value. the overriding factor which ensures the eventual materialization of new concepts and gives rise to effective approaches is marketing as a branch of applied science, the science of marketing has crucial value not only for developing countries like china which are making uttermost efforts to catch up with the developed countries, but also for the leading multinational giants in the developed countries themselves. 
</p>I also read a trade publication, which is talk about technology and computer software are applied in marketing field. This application much more improved the efficiency of sales. In sales, the first stage in computer use was standalone desktops and rudimentary software; companies moving into stage 2 now make salespeople part of an electronic communications network. Marketing is moving beyond that level to a 3rd generation of marketing information systems that extend the automation network to retail store checkout counters equipped with scanner equipment. Ruth Stanat, president of Strategic Intelligence Systems, says the strengths of such a system are in the weekly 
                                                            
structure of the database; its hierarchy of account, market, and national data; The system provides the accurate data in order to analysis market.</p>
  </p>I have an interview with my high school economic teacher. First, I asked what is his opinion on what is the definition of marketing, he said that: Marketing is an organizational function and for the benefit of the organization itself and stakeholders and creating, spreading and transmit customer value, customer relations, a series of process management. He also said that with the remarkable improvement of people's living                                                                               standard, the current market price is relatively high, some people think that more consumption is the necessaries of life, though, even if there is need to consumers, also may not to buy, or rarely buy. Some consumers because of some kind of trouble back at home, the part of saving their money, not for the cost of living, will form the "potential demand"; Other consumers, although have certain life source of income, but due to the limitation of current carrying quantity, cannot buy something he needed goods, also formed a "potential demand". Of course, there are quite a lot of customer with money can't afford their needed goods, therefore form a "potential demand". Potential demand of the objective existence is determined by the consumer life need of universality and expansibility. Potential demand is essentially has yet to meet customer demand, represented in terms of improving people's living standard and deficiency, and enterprises can develop the market in the "new world". I also asked him about my career direction, because I was confused about my future job. He 
                                                              
suggested to do the public relations activity in the future. He claimed that Enterprise as a member of a society with customers and other aspects of society there are objective. Improve and develop these connections can improve corporate social image, also can bring marketing benefits to the enterprise, namely to increase safety, ease of marketing. According to his opinion, commodity sales are only part of the marketing relationship between enterprises and customers. In fact, they can also be between development of economy, technology and social contacts and exchanges. By the bsmi in exchange link, between the two sides can enhance mutual trust and understanding, can be developed to depend on each other, help each other, share the joys and sorrows of partnership, allows businesses to gain a loyal customer base, can also be used to tedious negotiations change type for the practice of trading transactions, save transaction cost. The ideology of "relationship marketing" is also suitable for the development and improvement of enterprises and distributors, suppliers, transportation and warehousing business, financial institutions, propaganda media and the relationship between internal staff, make the enterprise in the process of marketing, can find can rely on, can be help strategic partner. Coordination and balance of public relations to deal with three relations, namely the commodity production and business operation and enterprise "socialization", the relationship between profit and meet the needs of the customer relationship and meet individual customer needs and improve social welfare.</p> 
 
                                                             
 </p>I also have an interview with my friend who is major in marketing as well, I asked him few question about why would he choose this major. As far as he concerned, 
marketing major provides good career prospect. Also his father is working relate to marketing, and own a small company; So he will take advance of this opportunity. </p>
