		<p>　With the remarkable improvement of people’s living standard, advanced science and technology add much spice to modern life. No doubt, Auto and the Internet, as examples of modern technology, play an increasingly significant role in modern life, because the world we live in is changing daily, many exciting things and events happened in every corner of the world; people want to know what is going on while they were staying at home, so the only way that getting to know the news around the world is Inter browsing and searching engine also bring convenience to our daily life. Internet can be used in a different field and performs individual function; however some hackers use internet to access personal or company’s computer in order to steal trade secret. In addition, the invention of Auto has greatly facilitated people’s live, with the technology improving many auto’s technology has come out as well, like a hybrid car which saves a huge cost in gasoline and decreases the pollution from off gas. In the contemporary age, our life is fill with technology, and it is impossible for me not to be impacted by it. One technology I love that has indicated me more than anything in decide my major and career is Auto. </p>

　　<p>I was born in an ordinary family, and my father started his business when I was two years old. His major business is selling art craft. The sales strategy was singleness, and the needs of the market were certain twelve years ago, due to the E-shop platform has not been set up yet at that time. I always asked my father why he would engage in this business. The reason I ask him is because he always complained the market competition of this field. However he told me a word, which I could never forget : I can not change the direction of the wind, but I can adjust my sails to always reach my destination.” In fact, my father has taught me a spirit, which I could never learn from the book is called persistence. With billion of Internet users increased per year, my father predicted that online shop would became the mainstream, so he changed his market analysis and spent more time and energy on building the online store. </p>

　                                                           
  <p>I love auto since I was three years old. In the beginning, I was so happy and curious that every time I saw a cool car speed on the road and it impressed me. Increasingly, I could recognize the brand of random car on the road. Once my father drove me to school, the car broke down in the half way to school then my father got off the car and opened the front hood while I was in the car and trying to move to the driving position because I always had an image in my mind that I spin the steering wheel and pretending I am driving, at that time, my dream came true even though my foot could not reach the accelerator. My father was laughing at me when he saw I was pretending drive earnestly. I feel very lucky to have always had a computer in my home while I was growing up and I started using Internet to look over the website about the car when I was in elementary school. For me, Internet is the only way makes me acquire knowledge and information, also broaden my vision. I would spend an hour on looking over the websites, mesmerized by everything from engine data, inside technology, and interior design. No doubt, technology gives me an illusion that information and real knowledge are easy to learn by clicking the mouse or watching interesting video. For instance, the autohome.com Which is a famous auto website in China that includes not only any auto’s picture and also the physical theory, I really acquired a lot information from this website, gradually, browsing this website has become the thing I have to done a day. In addition, I was good at physics, and I always got high score in the test during the high school. However, in a conversation with friend, his words reminds me, he told me that even I spent all the time on looking over the website it just on paper, but I still do not know what real driving feeling is, what is inside of car looks like including engine and clutch, I was so curious about how those things work when I watch the F1 racing game, so I went to the driving school when I just turned 18 years old because the legal age for driving is 18. From taking theory test to passing the driving test only took me 10 days. </p>

　　  <p>My major is marketing which after I take many factors into consideration then decide this major. This can be tracked back to when I was in my freshman year of high school since I am Interesting in both marketing and automotive, although I know they are totally different majors. In the text book, marketing is defined by the “process of communicating the value of product or service to customer.” Marketing is not simple as selling goods, which includes the critical function for attracting customer. However, automotive belongs to physical and mechanical major. After I take many factors into consideration and communicate with my parents I decided to be major in marketing, giving up the automotive major does not means I give up this hobby, I 
                                                              
want my future job relative to automotive. For instance, I could be a Market and Sale Director and employ in an auto company. While my current short goal is graduate from business school become auto marketer. I have a thought that I am gifted at marketing not only because my father engage in this filed; also I am really love this career. I have set up an online store on eBay, selling some footwear and apparel. My short goal is spending time and energy on my store, and find an internship during the summer vacation, because both of them could improve my ability and involve the same knowledge I have learned in college. For my future career, I will focus on market researching about auto and making the market analysis. In addition to research auto market, I have seen a researching report that how auto impacts the china’s economic, also author assumed that the auto market in china is booming and would soon become first in the world. </P>

<p>In brief, I have to work really hard from now on, also join in some clubs in order to improve my social ability and leadership. MSU campus also fill with technology, I was amazed by it. I feel very fortune to have this opportunity study aboard, accepting the best education and also to have my major relate to my dreaming dream. Although future is unpredictable, I will go for it for my dream, as my father said “always adjust my sails to reach the destination”. Technology had changed my life, helped me in discovering my future career. </p>
