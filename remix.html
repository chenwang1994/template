		<h1>Remix Memo</h1>
		<p> The topic we chose was gun control. The reason we chose this because there are many gun shot in current society. We made documentary video to show that if there no gun control on campus and interview with our group member. The audience just play themself because it might happen around them.We were dedicated to have great effects on audience. </p>
	<p>  The most challenging part of the project was communicate with group member, I don’t know about reason of member lacking, only one member contact and discuss withe me. It was so hard to make a 7 minutes video for two members. Since we only had two member, we had our topic really quick. The other member was KC ,who is really a good guy, he did most parts of project. I really appreciate!</p>
	<p>I didn’t really focus on resource, I was focusing on making video. I think we got few important statistics in our video, the statistics would have impact on audience.
</p>
<p>In our group, we didn’t have much discussions, and the only group member was KC, he gave a such great effort and he helped me a lot. It was so hard to make video for us. I wish I could pick group member by my own rather than randomly choose. 
</p>
<p>Project plan. We had a plan from the start we set meeting dates I was so disappointed when half the group fails to show up. We can’t finish on time because of they fail to show up. </p>
	<p>Gun control at Michigan state campus. The purpose of bringing gun to school ,self-defense or attack even just for show off. We intend to capture the facial expressions and actions of students who see the guy with gun on the belt.
