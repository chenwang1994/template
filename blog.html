		<p>I think the women as motivation in the Tech Industry. In the beginning of the film, Zack is quarreling with his girlfriend, and we could see he is smart also clever person. After girlfriend breaks up with him, he plans to do a great business and lets his girlfriend shocked.</p> 

</p>The invention of Facebook has really enhanced communicate between friend, and it provides a lot of fun. For some silent people, they would like post a blog on the Facebook rather than in daily, so I think the effect of technology is countless.</p>
  
</p>I think the The Correlation between Formal Education and Economic and Personal Success is that Formal Education pluses Economic equals Personal Success. It is so hard to achieve success for one who does not have formal education, the education as foundation plays an unique role in path of success. For instance, Zack and Bill Gates both of them didn’t finish their college education but it doesn’t means they lack of formal education, because they are able to get into the top one University in the state and pop up a good idea in the beginning of college time, therefore they drop out.

		 <p> Family is a very important for me, I think family is part of daily life in material as well as in spirit. It’s important not only because it provides us a place to live in, but also it supports us in spiritual aspect.
Family is the most familiar place for us, where there are our beloved families who care for and support to each other. In addition, it’s a place full filled with love, although it appears to be so common. The ordinary household affairs make us feel the warmth and happiness of family all the time. The most important is that family is our haven, a place where we are protected. It perhaps is the last station where we can lay down burden and get the real relax. 
When asked about their opinion of career and family, people always respond differently. Some people deem it more important to pursue their career, while there are always other people who argue that family should be the number one in one’s life.</p>
         <h1>blog4</h1>
		 <p>It goes without any question that career plays a key role in our life. In the very first place, career can give us an aim to live on. Without career, much of our living time will be certainly wasted. What’s more, career can provide us with a means to live on. Most of the people earn their income from a job. On the other hand, family is also an indispensable part of life, as many people will admit. Family is always regarded as a place where we can escape from troubles in life. In addition, we can obtain a sense of belonging to from family. Without it, anyone will feel lonely and desperate.
In my opinion, family are important, they can enhance each other so that one’s life can become better and better.  </p>

		 <p>I was an ordinary student who was study in china. I decided to study aboard in my sophomore year of high school. Actually, I was afraid to study aboard, because I was not good at english, so I was wondering how I am gonna talk with people. but now I think all I thought before are thinking too much. I could say I had good time now because I experienced too much things that I've never tried before.
First, I am glad that I made friend with American students, actually, I thought that is coolest thing when I was young, because different cultures and language it is hard to communicate, but I made it.
Second, I get all new education. I had studied in China for ten years and there are totally different means to teach student between China and America. Personally, I prefer America's education and I am glad I have opportunity to study in America.
However, it was extremely hard for me when I first day came to school. I remember the first class I took was Mr. Koos's US history which made feel so sad, because I couldn't understand any knowledge and he assigned homework for us, which I had no idea about that.
I had joined the JV basketball and I had hard time over there.
Third, I have been the homecoming dance, that was best experience for me. when I was in the China, I had watched a lot of American movie about the life in high school, I saw boy dress up and invite a girl go to the homecoming. I think my dream comes true.</p>
         <h1>blog6</h1>
		 <p> I have heard adults tell me that high school is going to be the best four years of my life. So far, they are right. I am so grateful for the opportunity to experience a public high school. I cherish every experience and relationship that I have made in my first three years of high school so far. Of course, as I move on with my life, I will value the education that high school has granted me. But it is the relationships that I have made with students and teachers that I will take with me as I graduate high school and move on to college.</p>

		  <p> I have had a bit of difficulty gathering my thoughts on the subject of Catholic Education.  At first I am a not Catholicism, how I get Catholic education ? I was ordinary student who was studying in china, I decided to study aboard in my sophomore year of high school, actually I didn't have any experience about catholic before I came here. The reason why I chose MCC was I thought I have to have experience a religion in my life, especially when I studied in the school. What is “education?”  And why do we pursue it?  To me these questions must be answered in reverse order to arrive at a satisfactory conclusion.
Far from being exclusively a “Catholic” belief, education was looked upon as the pursuit of truth in the universe and beyond.  It was a noble and worthy goal of all mankind.  The earliest pagans understood this even if the capacity for such was greatly limited.  And up until recently in human history the pursuit of the truth was believed in and honored by people of all religious, philosophical and cultural backgrounds. We have the Mass once a month, which is the central act of worship in the Catholic Church, which describes it as 'the source and summit of the Christian life ''. At my first came to Mass, I was kind of nervous because I've never been a worship ceremony like this, but I got use to this worship  because it really makes you feel comfortable. Since my first Mass, I have known Father Carroll who is a really nice person.</p>

		  <p>Friends are important in our life. They are always with us. When we are happy, we feel happy as we are. When we are sad, they try to cheer us up. Friendship is our necessity. It’s a warm feeling between you and your friends. This feeling makes you smile all the time. With friendship, your world seems brighter. It lights your life. Everyone needs friends and friendship.
I'll never forget the rainy day which I knew my best friend, Sean  
 It was a rainy day, I was sad in the rain, Sean came and told me, “Don’t be sad, no cross no crown. Believe that where there is a will, there is a way. Cheer up! I believe you'll succeed sooner or later." With these words, he patted me on the shoulder and took me into the classroom. Later, the rain stopped, and I saw beautiful rainbow appear and the sun was shining. Everything became wonderful and l gave her a big smile. 
Since then we have been the best friends. We share happiness and sorrow with each other. We work hard together and have made great progress. 
We always play basketball together，I could always felt satisfy，because he is a point guard who always control the ball. when we were in same team, he could give good assists and win the games.
Friendship is something we can't describe well in any language, but friendship does play an important role in our daily life and a good friend has a great influence on us. </p>

		 <p>I usually worry about...change. I would like to say that change is a problem and worth of consideration, change can either mould you or destroy you. Sometimes I think change would destroy me，which change my initial dream.

I feel angry when I am diffident. when I was young, I would not to try and change. Most of child at that age would show how confident they are，however I was totally opposite. With age growing，I still have this shortage. For instance, I usually show diffident when  I speaking in front of many people.
 

I am moody when somebody disturb me while I was studying. I like study in a quiet condition，because I can easily concentrate on the study，improving efficiency.


I'm happiest when I playing basketball. I love basketball and regard it as part of my life. I enjoy enthusiasm for playing basketball and I would never feel tired.  Cooperation is the key to success, I really learn a lot from basketball，not just for fun.</p>
         <h1>blog10</h1>
		 <p>I feel confident when my parents inspire me to do something. my father always says that within every human being，there is a hidden potential that only inspiration can help maximize. I think my parents is my power and I could achieve more with their inspiration.

I feel frustrated when my friend needs help but I couldn't give help. I don't need  rewarding feeling when I help my friend， I would like to do my best to see the smile on the face of those who are helped, so I will undoubtedly acquire a sense of fufillment. If I couldn't give help，I will feel frustrated.

I feel depressed when I lost my collection. I would have a delightful surprise when I find something useful and memorable and I regard them as collections. I love my collections which can remained me many stories. lost collection means lost memory for me, so I feel depressed when I couldn't them.</p>
         <h1>blog11</h1>
		 <p>I feel comfortable when I come back home. I think home is warmest place in this world，my mom would cook delicious food for me and my father would chat with me，I would like to share funny things with him. When I feel depressed，I also want to share with him，because I know he would cheer me up. I feel comfortable when I come back home.


I feel nervous when I singing and speaking in front of many people. I am a taciturn boy，I don't usually show confident face so that I am afraid of speech. However, I know I have to conquer and practice if I want to be a successful businessman. 

I feel sentimental when I sitting alone in a silent place . I would think about many unhappy things.  Silent place always remind and makes me feel sentimental. </p>
