		<h1>Course Retrospective</h1>
		<p> I was afraid of writing, the reason I choose WRA 110 because this class is required for entering the broad business college. I have no idea what to expect from the Science and Technology writing course, and I know there would be many essays waiting for me. I had a image that I failed this class. Writing is an important skill in our career, so I think this is a great opportunity to improve writing skill and overcome the fear from my deep heart. </p>
	    <p> When I first time walked in the WRA 110 class, I was amazed because every student was sitting in front of computer. I think this a great way to learn and improve the writing skill, I know this is a mix class which means we have some assignment online. with the technology improved, we usually tape the essay in computer and save as word document rather than write on real paper. Since I taking WRA 110, we usually use Eli review and Github these two websites, the one helps me a lot is Eli review which my classmate could comment and rate on my essay draft after I submit work, the comment and suggestion from my classmate are really helpful because they always have good suggestion and point some grammar problem in order to make me finish the final paper well. Github is the thing that I have been struggled with for the whole semester since first time professor taught us how to use this website and post own essay on it. I am really not good at computer and there are many work just like programming, however, with help from professor and friend, I could use Github by my own. </p>
	    <p> The first assignment was the Lived Experiences Project, I think this wast he most easiest one in these five projects. The requirement of word for this assignment is at least 1200 words, I have never written that much words before, so this was like a breakthrough for me. For this project, I will create a narrative detailing how a specific piece of technology has impacted your choice of a major and career at the present time. This topic was clear to me because I know the process of choosing the major. One technology I love that has indicated me more than anything in decide my major and career is Auto. I could tell that I love car so much, and I wrote this essay also to express the how I struggle with choosing major. My major is marketing which after I take many factors into consideration then decide this major. This can be tracked back to when I was in my freshman year of high school since I am Interesting in both marketing and automotive, although I know they are totally different majors. In the text book, marketing is defined by the “process of communicating the value of product or service to customer.” Marketing is not simple as selling goods, which includes the critical function for attracting customer. However, automotive belongs to physical and mechanical major. After I take many factors into consideration and communicate with my parents I decided to be major in marketing, giving up the automotive major does not means I give up this hobby. Also, we have turn in assignment as web version which means post on Github. </p>
	   	<p> The first blog I wrote was about a video, I had no idea with video because I did’t understand what was talking about even I repeat the video three times. I thought I would give up, but I didn’t give up watch the video until I understand it completely. Trevor’s story was a good example of the lived experiences, this video gives me rough idea about how a narrative style should be. </p>
	    <p> Cultural Analysis Proposal was the second assignment, the requirement for this assignment is more than first one, not only the word requirement also the specific content required. The requirement of word for second assignment is at least 1800 words. This is my first time to finish formal project like this. Unlike first assignment, to tell my story, in this assignment, we need to research an artifact of popular culture and analysis the social issue, also require to give a solution to solve this social issue. There was a challenge for me, which was finding resource. Since analysis an artifact, the resource is most important part. I could’t find a great resource to analysis my artifact. The artifact I chose is iPhone. “Since April 20, 2011, a hidden unencrypted file on the iPhone and other iOS devices has been widely discussed in the society. Two British security researchers, one of them was an Apple employee for few years, claimed that iPhone is tracking user’s location. It was alleged that the file, labeled "consolidated.db", constantly stores the iPhone user's movement by approximating geographic locations calculated by triangulating nearby cell phone towers, a technology proven to be inaccurate at times.The file was released with the June 2010 update of Apple iOS4 and may contain almost one year's worth of data. Previous versions of iOS stored similar information in a file called "h-cells.plist". </p>
	    <p> There was a in-class activity before we starting second assignment, we watched the Social Network. Actually this movie really inspired me for second assignment. Facebook is a good example of artifact of popular, since Mark Zuckerberg builded this social website, there were many social problems have come out. In my paper, I also analysis a popular artifact, and my social issue is about privacy. After we watched the Social Network, there were few questions, waiting our to answer, also was part of content that we should post on blog. </p>
	    <p> As the class went on, the assignment getting harder. I spent more time to finish third assignment than previous two. Formal Research Report was the third assignment, I had no idea when I open the assignment sheet. First, I didn’t get what formal report means, and depends on my writing ability I couldn’t make it formal. In class, we had an exercise to help differentiate between general (popular) article and scholarly (formal research) article. This exercise really helps me a lot on defined these two type of article and makes me clear on this project. The requirement of word for this assignment is at least 3,000 words, I was struggle with the words requirement even though we could use resources and materials from online library. There were also requirement for content, such as conducting an interview.</p>    
	    <p>  The fouth project was Remix project, I think this is most interesting one because this assignment requires to make a video with group members. I really enjoyed finishing the video with my group. I did perform in this video and it was so funny, I never thought I would required to make a video in WRA course. 
  I am currently working final project, this is a great opportunity to review what I have done during this semester. I see that I am actually learning more than I was expected because I was afraid of writing, for now I overcome the fear from my deep heart. I think this is an achievement. Also, I learned how to make small website which is Github, and post article on blog. I think this course not only improve my ability of writing also ability of communication.</p>
