			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p> First of all, I would like to share my experience with marketing major and my thought. As many people said that Many students come to higher education with only a vague idea of what it means to become a participating member of an academic discipline. The major I have chosen is marketing currently. Actually, I don’t know what marketing is before I took marketing class in my high school. My father, who is a businessman, started his business when I was two years old. His major business is selling art craft.

I was amazed by the story of my farther, and he told me a word, which I could never forget : I can not change the direction of the wind, but I can adjust my sails to always reach my destination.” I could always remember this every time when I in the slump. I think that I grow up with my father’s company, I was familiar with the products in his company. </p>
